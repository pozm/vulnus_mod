alt + f4
or open cmd and use ./injector ej and pray it works.

## building from source.
clone the project and then add run nuget restore to install dependancies,
then find where you have vulnus installed and add the various dependancies to that location.
now it should build correctly. i have a pipeline to build all into a neat folder, if you wish to get this just dm me or smth im too lazy rn.
